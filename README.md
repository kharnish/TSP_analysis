# TSP Fund Analysis

Some code to help determine the best way to invest your TSP funds. To get started, input your contribution history into `contributions.csv` (see `contributions_example.csv` for formatting your own contribution information). You will also want to update `share_prices.csv` from the [TSP website](https://www.tsp.gov/fund-performance/share-price-history/).
